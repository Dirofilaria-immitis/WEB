<p>Veterinary medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of disease,
<br>disorder, and injury in animals. Along with this, it also deals with animal rearing, husbandry, breeding, research on nutrition
<br>and product development. The scope of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated and wild, with a wide range of
<br>conditions which can affect different species.</p>
</div>

<div id="para2">
<p>Veterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional supervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician
<br>(also known as a vet, veterinary surgeon or veterinarian), but also by paraveterinary workers such as veterinary nurses or technicians.
<br>This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialisms such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry, and species relevant roles such as farriers.</p>

<p>Veterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of zoonotic disease (infectious disease transmitted from non-human animals to humans),
<br>food safety, and indirectly through human applications from basic medical research. They also help to maintain food supply
<br>through livestock health monitoring and treatment, and mental health by keeping pets healthy and long-living. Veterinary scientists
<br>often collaborate with epidemiologists and other health or natural scientists, depending on type of work. Ethically,
<br>veterinarians are usually obliged to look after animal welfare. Veterinarians diagnose, treat, and help keep animals safe and healthy.</p>
