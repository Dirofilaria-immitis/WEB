  <h2>DESIGN</h2>

  <div id="grid">

<p>A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process,
<br>or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.
<br>In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design)
<br>may also be considered to be a design activity. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic,
<br>functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment. Major examples of designs include
<br>architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns.[1]</p>

<p>The person who produces a design is called a designer, which is a term generally used for people who work professionally in one of the various design
<br>areasâ€”usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a textile designer, fashion designer, product designer, concept designer,
<br>web designer or interior designer), but also others such as architects and engineers. A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process,
<br>possibly using design methods. The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research,
<br>negotiation, reflection, modeling, interactive adjustment and re-design.</p>

Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur" target="_blank" title="amature">amateur</a> or professional,
<br>alone or in teams, produce designs.[2] Kees Dorst and Judith Dijkhuis, both designers themselves,
<br><br>argued that "there are many ways of describing design processes" and discussed "two basic and fundamentally different ways",[3]
<br>both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called "the rational model",[4] "technical problem solving"[5]
<br><br>and "the reason-centric perspective".[6] The alternative view has been called "reflection-in-action",[5] "co-evolution",[7]
<br>and "the action-centric perspective".[6]</p>

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
<br>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
<br><br>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms,
