<p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task.
<br>Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption,
<br>and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] </p>

<div id="para2">
<p>The source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding" target="_blank" title="coding">code of a program</a> is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code,
<br>which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate
<br>the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming
<br>thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, </p>
<br>specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

<p>Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance,
<br>implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs.
<br>These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming,
<br>implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.
<br>Reverse engineering is the opposite process. A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem,
<br>but it can also mean a security hacker in common language.</p>
